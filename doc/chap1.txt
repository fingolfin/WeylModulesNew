  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YPurpose[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  [5XGAP[105X  Package  supports digital computer computations with Weyl modules
  for   a   given  simple  simply-connected  algebraic  group  [23XG[123X  in  positive
  characteristic  [23Xp[123X.  Actually  the group [23XG[123X itself never appears in any of the
  computations,  which  take  place instead using the [13Xalgebra of distributions[113X
  (also  known  as  the  [13Xhyperalgebra[113X)  of  [23XG[123X, taken over the prime field. One
  should  refer to [Jan03] for the definition of the algebra of distributions,
  and other basic definitions and properties related to Weyl modules.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  algorithms  are  based  on  the method of [Irv86] (see also [Xi99]) and
  build  on  the  existing Lie algebra functionality in [5XGAP[105X. In principle, one
  can  work  with  arbitrary weights for an arbitrary (simple) root system; in
  practice,  the  functionality  is  limited  by the size of the objects being
  computed.  If  your Weyl module has dimension in the thousands, you may have
  to wait a very long time for certain computations to finish.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe package is possibly most useful for doing computations in characteristic
  [23Xp[123X,  where  [23Xp[123X is relatively small relative to the Coxeter number. The general
  theory  of  Weyl  modules [Jan03] includes a number of basic properties that
  break down (or are not known to hold) if the characteristic is too small. In
  such cases, explicit computations are often useful.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YRecall  that  a  [13Xmaximal  vector[113X  is  a weight vector which is killed by the
  positive  unipotent radical; equivalently, it is killed by the positive part
  of the algebra of distributions.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  main  technical  idea  underlying  this  package is the following fact:
  computing  all  the  maximal vectors in a given Weyl module [23XV[123X classifies the
  nonzero  Weyl  modules  [23XW[123X  for  which  a  nonzero homomorphism from [23XW[123X into [23XV[123X
  exists.  Such  homological  information  is  a powerful aid to understanding
  structural  properties of the Weyl module [23XV[123X. The implementation of this idea
  involves  a  brute  force search through each dominant weight space, examing
  all  linear  combinations (over the prime field) and compiling a list of the
  ones  which  are  maximal.  This  exploits  the  pleasant fact that for Weyl
  modules  of small dimension, the weight spaces tend to be small enough to be
  manageable.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAlthough  most  of the functions deal with the simple simply-connected case,
  there  are  a  few  functions  for dealing with Schur algebras and symmetric
  groups.  Those  commands  are  limited  in  scope,  and provided mainly as a
  convenience.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.2 [33X[0;0YCounterexample to Donkin's conjecture[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  2019,  Chris  Bendel,  Dan  Nakano,  Cornelius  Pillen,  and Paul Sobaje
  [BNPS20]   found   the  first  counterexample  to  Donkin's  tilting  module
  conjecture  using  this  package.  This  important  advance  led  to further
  development of the package.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.3 [33X[0;0YChangeLog[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe initial release was Version 1.0 in 2009.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y1.  Versions  1.0 and 1.1 were released in 2009. The initial development was
  spurred by work on the paper [BDM11].[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y2.  Version  2.0  was  released  on 29 February 2024. The [9XSubmoduleStructure[109X
  command was eliminated. Support was added for subquotients.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y3.   Version   2.1  (this  version)  was  released  on  21  June  2024.  The
  documentation was completely rewritten. There is more support for submodules
  and  subquotients,  including  the  new  functions:  [9XSocleLengthTwoQuotient[109X,
  [9XTwoFactorQuotientsContaining[109X.  These  can  be used to obtain Ext information
  about a Weyl module.[133X
