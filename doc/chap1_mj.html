<h4>1.1 <span class="Heading">Purpose</span></h4>

<p>This <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> Package supports digital computer computations with Weyl modules for a given simple simply-connected algebraic group <span class="SimpleMath">\(G\)</span> in positive characteristic <span class="SimpleMath">\(p\)</span>. Actually the group <span class="SimpleMath">\(G\)</span> itself never appears in any of the computations, which take place instead using the <em>algebra of distributions</em> (also known as the <em>hyperalgebra</em>) of <span class="SimpleMath">\(G\)</span>, taken over the prime field. One should refer to <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBJantzen">[Jan03]</a> for the definition of the algebra of distributions, and other basic definitions and properties related to Weyl modules.</p>

<p>The algorithms are based on the method of <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBIrving">[Irv86]</a> (see also <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBXi">[Xi99]</a>) and build on the existing Lie algebra functionality in <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>. In principle, one can work with arbitrary weights for an arbitrary (simple) root system; in practice, the functionality is limited by the size of the objects being computed. If your Weyl module has dimension in the thousands, you may have to wait a very long time for certain computations to finish.</p>

<p>The package is possibly most useful for doing computations in characteristic <span class="SimpleMath">\(p\)</span>, where <span class="SimpleMath">\(p\)</span> is relatively small relative to the Coxeter number. The general theory of Weyl modules <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBJantzen">[Jan03]</a> includes a number of basic properties that break down (or are not known to hold) if the characteristic is too small. In such cases, explicit computations are often useful.</p>

<p>Recall that a <em>maximal vector</em> is a weight vector which is killed by the positive unipotent radical; equivalently, it is killed by the positive part of the algebra of distributions.</p>

<p>The main technical idea underlying this package is the following fact: computing all the maximal vectors in a given Weyl module <span class="SimpleMath">\(V\)</span> classifies the nonzero Weyl modules <span class="SimpleMath">\(W\)</span> for which a nonzero homomorphism from <span class="SimpleMath">\(W\)</span> into <span class="SimpleMath">\(V\)</span> exists. Such homological information is a powerful aid to understanding structural properties of the Weyl module <span class="SimpleMath">\(V\)</span>. The implementation of this idea involves a brute force search through each dominant weight space, examing all linear combinations (over the prime field) and compiling a list of the ones which are maximal. This exploits the pleasant fact that for Weyl modules of small dimension, the weight spaces tend to be small enough to be manageable.</p>

<p>Although most of the functions deal with the simple simply-connected case, there are a few functions for dealing with Schur algebras and symmetric groups. Those commands are limited in scope, and provided mainly as a convenience.</p>

<h4>1.2 <span class="Heading">Counterexample to Donkin's conjecture</span></h4>

<p>In 2019, Chris Bendel, Dan Nakano, Cornelius Pillen, and Paul Sobaje <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBBNPS">[BNPS20]</a> found the first counterexample to Donkin's tilting module conjecture using this package. This important advance led to further development of the package.</p>

<h4>1.3 <span class="Heading">ChangeLog</span></h4>

<p>The initial release was Version 1.0 in 2009.</p>

<p>1. Versions 1.0 and 1.1 were released in 2009. The initial development was spurred by work on the paper <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBBDM">[BDM11]</a>.</p>

<p>2. Version 2.0 was released on 29 February 2024. The <code class="keyw">SubmoduleStructure</code> command was eliminated. Support was added for subquotients.</p>

<p>3. Version 2.1 (this version) was released on 21 June 2024. The documentation was completely rewritten. There is more support for submodules and subquotients, including the new functions: <code class="keyw">SocleLengthTwoQuotient</code>, <code class="keyw">TwoFactorQuotientsContaining</code>. These can be used to obtain Ext information about a Weyl module.</p>
